You are given a lists T1 and T2 of n and m integers, respectively, in the range [0, k], representing the heights of two teams of players. You may preprocess T1 and T2 in O(m + n + k) time. You must give an algorithm that runs in O(1) time–so that you can run the algorithm on both teams in a constant amount of time–with the following behavior:

Given: two integers a ∈ [0,k] and b ∈ [0,k], where a ≤ b.

Output: the number of integers in T1 in the range [a, b], and the number of integers in T2 in [a, b].
