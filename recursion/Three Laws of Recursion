# Three Laws of Recursion
- A recursive algorithm must have a **base case**;
    - **Base case:**
      - The condition that allows the algorithm to stop the recursion;
      - A problem that can be solved directly
- A recursive algorithm must change its state and move toward the base case;
  - Usually data gets smaller
- A recursive algorithm must call it self, recursively.
